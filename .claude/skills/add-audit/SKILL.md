description: Add an opt-in local audit log for the ncl command surface — every dispatch outcome on both transports (host socket and container), including scope denials, approval holds, and approved replays, written as SIEM-shaped append-only NDJSON day-files under data/audit/. Read back with `ncl audit list`; plug exporters in via registerAuditHook. Off until AUDIT_ENABLED=true.

# /add-audit — Local Audit Log (ncl surface)

Records one canonical audit event for every command that reaches the `ncl`
dispatcher — human over the host socket or agent over the container transport
— including denials. Both transports converge on the exported `dispatch`, so
one composition covers the whole surface: there is no second door.

```
ncl (host socket) ──┐
                    ├─→ dispatch = withAudit(dispatchInner) ─→ one NDJSON line
container cli_request ┘        │                               data/audit/<UTC-day>.ndjson
approved replay (grant) ───────┘
```

What one event carries: `actor` (`host:<os-user>` or the agent group),
`origin` (transport, session, channel), dotted `action` from the guard
catalog (e.g. `groups.config.add-mcp-server`), touched/attempted `resources`,
`outcome` (`success · failure · denied · pending`), `correlation_id` (the
approval id on gated chains — the pending event and the approved replay share
it, so `--correlation <id>` returns the whole chain), and redacted `details`.

Scope of this increment: the ncl dispatch surface only. Approval-lifecycle
events (request/decision as their own events), OneCLI credential holds, and
channel/sender events are later increments — they attach to `src/audit/` as
pure adds (new `*.audit.ts` adapters and observer subscriptions).

## Steps

### 0. Pre-flight (idempotency)

The apply is safe to re-run; every step below is guarded. Skip to
**Enable** if all of these already hold:

- `src/audit/` exists
- `src/cli/resources/index.ts` contains `import './audit.js';`
- `src/cli/dispatch.ts` contains `export const dispatch = withAudit(dispatchInner);`

Before editing, verify the reach-in targets still exist: `src/cli/dispatch.ts`
must contain `export async function dispatch(` (or the already-applied
composition), and `src/cli/resources/index.ts` must be the resource barrel (a
list of `import './<resource>.js';` lines). If either has moved, stop and
adapt rather than guessing.

### 1. Copy the payload

From the NanoClaw project root:

```bash
cp -R "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/add/src/." src/
```

What lands (mirrors of the destination paths):

- `src/audit/` — the domain-free leaf: event schema (`types.ts`), env config
  (`config.ts`), redactor, NDJSON day-file store, emit seam, post-write hooks,
  reader, boot/maintenance wiring, vocabulary — plus its tests.
- `src/cli/dispatch.audit.ts` — the CLI adapter: `withAudit` middleware and
  the actor/origin/resource mapping (+ `dispatch.audit.test.ts`).
- `src/cli/resources/audit.ts` — the read-only `ncl audit` resource.
- `src/audit-wiring.test.ts` — goes red if either core edit below is deleted
  or drifts.

### 2. Register the resource

Append to `src/cli/resources/index.ts` (skip if the line is already present):

```typescript
import './audit.js';
```

### 3. Compose the dispatch middleware

This is the skill's one functional reach-in, in `src/cli/dispatch.ts`. Three
small edits:

1. Add the import (next to the other `./` imports):

   ```typescript
   import { withAudit } from './dispatch.audit.js';
   ```

2. Rename the dispatcher declaration — change

   ```typescript
   export async function dispatch(
   ```

   to

   ```typescript
   async function dispatchInner(
   ```

3. Directly after that function's closing brace (before the
   `registerApprovalHandler('cli_command', …)` block), add:

   ```typescript
   // Audit middleware (installed by /add-audit): the exported dispatch is the
   // wrapped function, so both transports and the approved replay below all
   // pass the one composition.
   export const dispatch = withAudit(dispatchInner);
   ```

The composition must live at the definition site (not at the import sites):
the approved-replay handler in the same file calls `dispatch(...)` too, and
only the wrapped export covers it. `src/audit-wiring.test.ts` asserts exactly
this shape via the TypeScript AST.

Loading `dispatch.audit.ts` also boots the audit log: on an enabled box it
asserts `data/audit/` is writable (refusing to start beats a silent audit
gap), runs the boot retention prune, and arms an unref'd maintenance timer.
Nothing else in core changes — no `index.ts` or `host-sweep.ts` edits.

### 4. Enable

Add the two settings to `.env` (idempotent — overwrite or append):

```bash
grep -q '^AUDIT_ENABLED=' .env && sed -i.bak 's/^AUDIT_ENABLED=.*/AUDIT_ENABLED=true/' .env && rm -f .env.bak || echo 'AUDIT_ENABLED=true' >> .env
grep -q '^AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=' .env || echo 'AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=90' >> .env
```

`AUDIT_ENABLED` is the master switch — off (or absent) means `emitAuditEvent`
is a no-op and `data/audit/` is never created. `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS`: day
files strictly older than the horizon are hard-deleted (unlinked) at boot and
once per UTC day; `0` = keep forever; unset = 90.

### 5. Build and test

Run `build` before the tests — it's what catches a missed copy or a drifted
import path across the whole composed tree:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm exec vitest run src/audit src/cli/dispatch.audit.test.ts src/audit-wiring.test.ts
pnpm test
```

### 6. Restart the service

```bash
source setup/lib/install-slug.sh
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/$(launchd_label)   # macOS
# systemctl --user restart $(systemd_unit)             # Linux
```

### 7. Verify (runtime smoke)

```bash
ncl groups list                     # any command — this one is now an audit event
cat data/audit/$(date -u +%F).ndjson | tail -1
ncl audit list --limit 5
```

The last line of the day-file is the `groups.list` event you just caused.

## Reading it back

```
ncl audit list [--actor <id>] [--action <name-or-prefix>] [--resource <id-or-type>]
               [--outcome success|failure|denied|pending|approved|rejected]
               [--since 7d|24h|30m|ISO] [--until …] [--correlation <approval-id>]
               [--limit N] [--format ndjson]
```

Newest first, default limit 100. `--action groups.config` matches the whole
dotted subtree. `--format ndjson` streams the stored lines verbatim — pipe to
a file for SIEM import. On a disabled box the command errors with
`audit log is disabled — set AUDIT_ENABLED=true` rather than returning an
empty list that would read as "no actions happened".

The resource is deliberately **not** on the group-scope allowlist: audit
spans agent groups, so group-scoped agents are refused before the handler
(fails closed). Host callers and `cli_scope: global` agents only.

## Redaction, failure posture, exporters

- Every event's `details` passes a recursive key-pattern redactor
  (`/(token|secret|key|password|credential|auth|bearer)/i` → `[REDACTED]`,
  ~2 KB per-value cap) at the single emit seam.
- Fail-open + loud: a failed append is `log.error`'d and the audited action
  proceeds. At boot, an enabled box refuses to start if `data/audit/` isn't
  writable.
- In-process exporters register via `registerAuditHook` (from
  `src/audit/index.js`) — post-write hooks that fire only after the local
  append succeeds, so an external system can never be ahead of the source of
  truth. Ship one as its own `/add-*` skill; declare `/add-audit` as its
  dependency.

## Troubleshooting

- **Host won't start, banner names the audit directory** — `AUDIT_ENABLED=true`
  but `data/audit/` isn't writable. Fix permissions or disable audit.
- **`audit log is disabled — set AUDIT_ENABLED=true`** — the read-back guard;
  enable in `.env` and restart.
- **An agent gets "CLI access is scoped to this agent group" for `ncl audit`**
  — by design; grant the group `cli_scope: global` only if it should read
  cross-group history.
- **`pnpm test` on an enabled box adds a few events to today's day-file** —
  expected: the base dispatch tests drive real dispatches. Harmless noise;
  the audit test suites themselves write only to temp dirs or capture buffers.

## Removal

See [REMOVE.md](REMOVE.md) — reverses every change; existing day-files are
left in place (they're the operator's records).
